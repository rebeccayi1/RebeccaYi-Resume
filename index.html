        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently a 4th year college student at the University of California, Riverside, Rebecca Yi aims to complete her Bachelor of Arts in Psychology this summer. Although she is a psychology major, she wishes to become a nurse practitioner by earning a Master of Science in Nursing, and possibly study further to obtain a degree in Doctor of Nursing Practice. She ultimately seeks to open a clinic of her own and work independently as a nurse practitioner. She is a determined and largely motivated person who strives to achieve the best in any and every area of her life. She is highly organized and pays great attention to detail, seeking perfection in all that she does. She does not settle for anything less.<br><br>

        In the year of 2019, during the month of December, Rebecca Yi first joined the COPE Health Scholars Program. The program consists of students interested in pursuing a career in the medical field and allows them to get a hands-on experience in a medical setting. In order to get accepted into the program, Rebecca had to submit an application for review, take an interview, and pass a practical and a written test. She is currently still working in the program but set to graduate by March 2021. The departments she has served at include surgical telemetry, physical medicine, and postpartum. The current departments she is serving at are pediatrics and family medicine. Her tasks consist of, first and foremost, serving patients, assisting nurses in projects, restocking linens and supplies, among more. Serving in the hospital has exposed her to many different patients and situations, providing her experience that will certainly be useful in her future endeavors as a nurse. It has also allowed her to get connected to nurses and doctors, allowing for social work connections. In addition, while studying at UCR, Rebecca has served the past four years as a church leader at Grace Ministries International. For two years she served in the Pre-K department, teaching kindergartners about the love of Jesus Christ, and then she moved onto high school. It is currently her second year serving in the high school ministry, continuing to share the love of Jesus, but also as a leader walking with students in and throughout their lives. She feels grateful and blessed to be able to serve others in a way like so and wishes to extend her servitude to even more people.<br><br>

        Rebecca Yi is a Korean American, born in Los Angeles, California. She was raised in Orange County but has since moved many times. She grew up dancing but stopped in middle school. She also tried learning piano diligently but ultimately failed to continue. Rebecca has spent a few of her years living out of the country, allowing her to learn the Spanish language (and some French). Therefore, she is now trilingual, speaking English, Korean, and Spanish. She is not fluent in French; however, she is able to read and understand a bit of the language. She enjoys playing video games, reading, baking, and spending time with family.
